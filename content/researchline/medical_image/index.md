We coordinated the FP7 European Project "<a class="one" href="http://www.softcomputing.es/mibisoc/">MIBISOC:</a> Medical Imaging using Bio-inspired and Soft Computing" that supported our work on medical image segmentation and registration.
Image segmentation is commonly defined as the partitioning of an image into non-overlapping regions that are homogeneous with respect to some visual feature, such as color or texture.
 In many medical imaging applications, segmentation algorithms play a crucial role by automatically identifying anatomical structures and other regions of interest. 
 Such algorithms are nowadays in the core of multiple tasks, like quantification and measurement of tissue volumes, localization of pathologies or computer-integrated surgery. 
 It is important to highlight that manual segmentation is not only tedious and time consuming but, sometimes, also inaccurate, hence the importance of developing automatic and accurate segmentation methods.
 We have applied Soft Computing and Machine Learning in image segmentation using deformable models.
In its most general formulation, image registration (IR) is the task of aligning two or more images in order to establish a spatial correspondence of their common content. 
Such images usually have the same or a similar subject but have been acquired under different conditions, such as time and viewpoint, or by multiple sensors. 
In medical image analysis, IR is a key technology that allows to "fuse" visual information from different sources. Applications include combining images of the same subject from different modalities,
 detecting changes before/after treatment, aligning temporal sequences of images to compensate for motion between scans, image guidance during interventions and aligning images from multiple subjects in cohort studies.
 We have tackled medical IR with different metaheuristics following feature-based and intensity-based approaches.
