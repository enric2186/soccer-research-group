We have used evolutionary multi-objective optimization and multi-objective ant colony optimization algorithms to solve a challenging real-world problem, the time and space assembly line problem (TSALBP), which involves to achieve optimal assignments of a subset of tasks to each station of the assembly line of a plant with respect to two or three conflicting objectives to be minimized: its cycle time, its number of stations and their area. This framework emerged thanks to the observation of a real automotive industry plant belonging to Nissan and located in Barcelona, Spain, as this research was performed in collaboration with the <a class="one" href="http://www.nissanchair.com/?lang=en">Prothius Industrial Engineering Chair</a> (formerly Nissan Endowed Chair) of the Technical University of Catalonia, headed by Prof. Joaqu√≠n Bautista.
