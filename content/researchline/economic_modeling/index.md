The IRAM lab is involved in a technological alliance with a marketing consultancy called <a href=https://www.zio-analytics.com/><b>R0D Brand Consultants</b> </a>. Our developments include the design of two different kinds of economic models. The first one is aimed for strategic branding. It is based on a macro-level, top-down approach implemented by a systems dynamics methodology which incorporates fuzzy logic to model relations between tangible and intangible macroscopic variables (e.g. brand equity, loyalty, HR budget, etc.), machine learning and social network analysis techniques to select the most relevant variables, and genetic algorithms for strategic action optimization. The model allows clients to incorporate both the existing data in their companies (reputation studies, surveys, etc.) along with their expert knowledge. It has already become a commercial product called <b>Zio® SD</b>.

The second model deals with consumer mix modelling. It thus follows a micro-level, bottom-up approach considering an agent-based computational economics model to recreate competitive markets for modelling and predicting sales, touchpoints, perceptions, awareness, and word-of-mouth. Simulated consumers have an active decision making procedure based on their perceptions and awareness of the existing brands in the artificial market and they are also connected by a social network modeling diffusion processes. The system, called <b>Zio® ABM</b>, allows for market understanding and for the handling of what if scenarios to observe the impact of investments on the cons*umers in terms of sales evolution.
