abstract: "COVID-19 pandemic has impacted millions of people and the global economy and tourism has been one the most affected economic sectors. We propose an evolutionary game model that reflects a collective risk dilemma behind these decisions, given that the dependence on tourism of each region is diverse. Our analysis shows that the existence of heterogeneous costs enhances global agreements. A layout of groups based on similar costs of cooperation boosts the regions' agreements and avoid the risk of having a total lock-down and a negligible tourism activity"
