<i>Visual science maps (scientograms)</i> are a powerful tool to represent and analyze scientific information. They comprise high quality, schematic visualizations for huge scientific domains. The <a class="one" href="http://www.scimago.es/">Scimago research group</a> has developed a <a class="one" href="http://www.scimagojr.com/mapgen.php">methodology</a> to design scientograms based on the combined use of Thomson’s Web of Science JCR® or Elsevier Scopus® co-citation information and social network analysis through the use of the <a class="one" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_network">Pathfinder network pruning algorithm</a>. 
This methodology is integrated in their <a class="one" href="http://www.scimagojr.com/">SCImago Journal & Country Rank</a> web information system. The SOCCER lab members have developed new network pruning algorithms for scientogram design that are incorporated into this system. These methods significantly reduce the Pathfinder run time, allowing us to generate scientograms of very large scientific domains (even of the whole World production) in an on-line fashion.<br>

Meanwhile, we have also made significant developments to the analysis of scientograms by means of single and multi-objective graph mining methods. Information science experts are not able to deal with the complex task of analyzing a large number of scientograms. We have thus performed scientogram mining in order to analyze and compare the structure of scientific fields and research fronts in maps of the same (taken at different periods of time) or different domains (looking for similarities between different countries scientific productions). In particular, we have developed pioneering, general-purpose graph mining techniques using multi-objective and multimodal evolutionary algorithms to evaluate subgraphs based on different conflicting criteria such as support and size. Our methods can be customized to different learning tasks and are able to retrieve a Pareto set of non-dominated, meaningful subgraphs from a structural database in a single run. In addition, this approach allows us to uncover less frequent subgraphs that describe the underlying phenomena from different angles, revealing novel information that otherwise would have been hidden by uninformative frequent descriptions.
