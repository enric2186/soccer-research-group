We are a pioneering research group applying soft computing and computer vision techniques to the forensic identification field since we started our collaboration with the Physical Anthropology Lab of the University of Granada headed by the prestigious Dr. Miguel Botella in 2006. After almost ten years we have published in the most prestigious journals in both the forensic and artificial intelligence fields. We have coordinated several research projects, highlighting the FP7 European Project “<b>MEPROCS</b>: New methodologies and protocols in forensic identification by craniofacial superimposition”. We are currently collaborating with the most prestigious forensic labs in Europe such as CAHID, LABANOF, or the Israel National Police. Our main contribution to the field refers to the automation of the Craniofacial Superimposition (CFS) technique. CFS is intended to determine whether a skull found corresponds to a particular person through the superimposition of the former over one or more photographs of the face of the latter and the posterior morphological analysis of their correspondence. An hybridization of computer vision, fuzzy logic and evolutionary algorithms resulted in the most advanced computer-aided system to assist the forensic anthropologist in the identification of a missing person by CFS, Face2Skull. This system has been developed in collaboration with the ECSC after obtaining the corresponding international patent. Further information about this research line can be found at <b>SOCOVIFI</b> webpage. We are now exploring new applications to other skeleton-based profiling and identification techniques.
